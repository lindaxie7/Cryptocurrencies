# Cryptocurrencies
This project aims to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data we are working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, unsupervised learning is used. To group the cryptocurrencies, I use the clustering algorithm. Also, 2D and 3D scatter plot data visualizations to share the findings.




## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
